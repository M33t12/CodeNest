Here Detailed project Information : 

Technologies : 
Frontend: React , react-router-dom , zustand(for state management) , tailwindcss 
Backend : MongoDB , express.js

Module : User module
I want role based access : Which user have which permissions ? 
Two roles :

User : Normal User
Admin : Specialized user :

What user can do ? 
-- user can upload resources , view resources upload by other users:
-- Resources have type : [pdf, link , image, text-if user want to add , blogs]

What Admin can do ?
For Resources that are added by any users , first goes to the admin to verify the resource, if resource permits then the resource will be visible in website
Admin dashboard have all users data like [no of users, open the profile of each user , view each user's profile---> contains how many resources are uploaded by users, and also view particular resource]
-Admin can add other admins
-admin have the rights to block other users also...
-admin have all the information of all users of website

How admin verify the resources ::
1. user upload the resource.
2. Resource is sent to the admin for verification.
3. Admin can verify the resources by Ai-Model, Ai-model give verdicts based on the authenticity of resource,subject-area,is it useful or not
4. Based on the Ai-model verdicts Admin can approve the resources/reject the resources.
5. after approval it will be displayed to all the users in resources section of website.


Module : Resources 
Display all resources added by users, resources can be filter out based on the ratings of other users, by subject , by link , pdfs, blogs
resource model :
Each resource have following and includes that are necessary to handle :

--rating of resource
-- by users[on the scale of 1-5];
--upload by which user

Module : DSA Practice
-- Specialized module for only user 
-- User can practice their DSA Questions by topic wise and tracks the progress
-- User can solve Questions directly to Leetcode throgh redirection

This module contains DSA Questions :
Each Question include information:
-- In which topic question belongs to
-- can be tracked as solved/unsolved/attempted--similar
-- level of question : easy/medium/hard

Any other information that needed for tracking

Module : AI Module:
Contains two main Parts :
1. AI model generates Quiz (It generates Quiz for subject or any study subject)
--based on the information : 
----no_of_question
----type_of_subject
----level_of_question_generates
----or include any similar information

2.AI Model Takes Interview of user :

-- Get the information of DSA Tracking of user profile : 
--How many question solved by user
--question solved in hard/medium/easy level

Frontend : uses JSX syntax for writing code
Backend : use javascript syntax

User Authentication :
-- Done using the jwt and bcryptjs

#Resources Module :
-- Authentication of user is done by jwt ,
-- user upload resource , show its status in its profile , 
-- User can upload the resource related to computer Science in resource module:
-- Resources have ratings on the scale of 0 to 5
-- after upload resources the resources are goes to admin : 
-- admin verify the resources through AI Agent and Give suggestions to approved or not
-- if AI Agent gives positive feedback then , Resources are approved by admin
-- now User's resource is visible to all the users


Idea About Resource Module :
-- User can upload resources in resource section :
-- Resource can be anything (PDF , Images , Any link of Resource , Blogs ,Markdown File)
-- I want one form where if user selects resources like pdf ,images then it handles by cloudinary to store and manage
and then link stored in the database , i want one editor where i can write the blogs with images and text and some formatting tools,
-- After resource is uploaded ,, resources are sent to the admin for verification of resources,
-- resource status must be visible to user in their profile section and he can saw all the resources upload by him/her
-- Admin verify the resource using AI Model and Gives feedback for authentic resource , 
-- if AI gives positive feedback then admin approved resource 
-- approved resources visible to all users under resource section...
-- To view the resource , resource must be viewable , all type of resources like image ,pdf ,markdown file or blogs..
-- use different route for view specific resource...


Admin Modules::
Admin Have this type of analytics ::
1. user management
-- delete user
-- block/unblock user
-- promote/demote to or from admin
2.resource management
-- approve/reject resource
-- analyze/re-analyze the uploaded resources for approval/rejection
-- based on the response of ai-agent it approve/reject
-- detail ai-analysis also there
3.Ai-dashboard-analysis
4.analytics and report

DSA Module:
1.Use Leetcode Graphql API for listing the problems
2.Use JWT based Authentication.
3.Listing of problems with Filters by difficulty, by topics and search by Title also.
4.Problem can be solved in real-time by redirecting to the LeetcodePlatform.
5.Problem can be marked as solved, attempted , not-started.
6.You can also add notes to each problem ::
-- adding notes, solution-approach , time-taken....
